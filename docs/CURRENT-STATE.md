# Compiler current state

This is the compact current-state authority for the standalone compiler. A
handoff or audit may preserve older findings, but its numbers are historical
unless it links a new run.

## Implemented

- C++17 build and command-line front end.
- Lexer, parser, AST, semantic checks, constant evaluation, and initialization
  planning for the current SysY2022 scope.
- Structured IR and reader/verifier, loop normalization, and structured dumps.
- Flattening into the flat CFG/SSA-oriented IR and flat dumps.
- Runtime signature catalog and source location tracking.
- `IREmitter` and `LLVMTextEmitter`, which render verified flat modules as
  target-neutral opaque-pointer LLVM IR text.

The default product path now verifies the structured and flat modules before
emitting LLVM IR; `--from-flat` accepts a serialized flat module. Unsupported
emission fails without creating or overwriting the output file. The text is
target-independent and does not include triple or data layout. `-O1` remains
an option record and does not enable optimization.

## Next milestone

S07 is implemented. The next milestone is S08, the standalone SSA invariant
checker. End-to-end execution and target-code runtime measurements remain
unimplemented and must not be inferred from LLVM assembly validation.

## Validation ledger

Latest S07 LLVM manifest run (2026-09-29):
`python3 tools/selftest/check_llvm_ir.py --root /home/koki1/try --compiler
build/compiler --llvm-as /usr/lib/llvm-18/bin/llvm-as --jobs 8 --timeout 30
--work /tmp/s07-final4 --report /tmp/s07-final4.json` reports **490 PASS, 50
FRONTEND_REJECT, 0 FAIL, 0 TIMEOUT**. Every supported `.ll` assembled with LLVM
18.1.3; each tensor item produced a diagnostic and no `.ll`. Archived phase report
and per-case JSON evidence are in the companion workspace at
[`S07 report`](../../docs/handoff/reports/07-S07.md) and
[`manifest JSON`](../../docs/handoff/reports/07-S07-llvm-manifest.json).

The S07 emitter fixes include LLVM `\xx` quoted-name escaping, `fpext` values
typed as `double` at their variadic `putf` ABI boundary, and specific tensor
frontend-rejection diagnostics recorded per manifest case. The manifest checker
has negative controls for unrelated errors being misclassified as tensor
rejections. The 2026-09-29 rerun reports **490 PASS, 50 FRONTEND_REJECT, 0 FAIL,
0 TIMEOUT**. S05b reports 399 trajectory matches, 0 differences, and 141
explicit skips: 89 step-budget, 50 tensor frontend rejection, and 2 recursion
depth. Skips are not passes; the gate passed its minimum 200-case coverage
because 399 cases were actually compared.

The earlier integrated S07 run failed its S05b launch while `build/compiler`
was concurrently rebuilt, and its S11 target checks also failed. Both records
are retained. The S07 stage wiring now skips S11 target execution when an
explicit earlier stage is requested. A subsequent full integrated run passed
S05b and the S06 structural checks, but did not complete the S06 flat execution
comparison during this session; therefore no full `verify.sh --stage S07`
success is claimed yet. See the dated addendum in the S07 report and the
captured command output. LLVM assembly proves text acceptance only; it does
not prove target execution correctness or performance.

Capability requirements: S07 requires real `.ll` validation with `llvm-as` and
the exact supported manifest. S11 requires the three target pipelines and exact
manifest execution evidence; S11b requires the same contract through the toy
backend. `--quick` is a smoke check and cannot satisfy a requested capability
gate. The 490 non-tensor / 50 tensor split is a corpus scope fact, not a result
invented by this document. Full corpus gates may require the workspace's
external corpus and runtime; standalone clones must remain portable without
those assets for local checks.

## Reading paths

Read `src/frontend/` for source semantics and runtime adaptation,
`src/structured/` for structured ownership and lowering, `src/ir/` for the
flat data model and verifier, and `src/support/` for diagnostics and shared
utilities. Read the matching contract in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before
crossing one of those boundaries.
